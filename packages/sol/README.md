# Sol (LiteSpace Shared Logic.)

This package contains ancillary functions for each entity/model in the project, or more generally any aspect. e.g. it may include and share simple entity-related function logic like `calculateLessonPrice(...)` in [src/lesson.ts](./src/lesson.ts), or it may include the long tedious and verbose logic for verification (i.e. data validation) in [src/verification.ts](./src/verification.ts).
